    <string name="explanation">Welcome to Once Upon a Grapefruit, a collaborative storytelling game! The premise of the game is quite simple: write a line to a story then pass it to a friend and repeat. The current writer can only see what the previous person wrote, and must write their part solely based off of that. Nonsensical hilarity ensues!</string>
